## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I wanted investigate as a host or investor how to make the most revenue for a night in a Airbnb stay.
For this I used data from Airbnb (listings.csv) compiled in 20 June, 2022 for Rio de Janeiro available [here](http://data.insideairbnb.com/brazil/rj/rio-de-janeiro/2022-06-20/visualisations/listings.csv) the following questions: 

*   How much concentrated is the marketshare of Airbnb's stays for Rio de Janeiro.
*   What neighboorhoods have less competition as a host.
*   What neighboorhoods have the most expensive listings.
*   What it takes as a host to get the most value per night.
